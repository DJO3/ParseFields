Takes a PDF with fields as input and dumps all text from those fields into a txt file. 

PDF location can be set either on run via terminal or in config.py. All other variable in config.py need to be set and directory path may not contain any spaces, such as /Dropbox (Personal)/.

Built upon a modified version of xml parsing code posted by Jason Sundram.
